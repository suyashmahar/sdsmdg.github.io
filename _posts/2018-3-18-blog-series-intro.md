The Unamed Blog Series
======================

Why a new blog series?
----
At MDG we believe that everyone should have access to similar
resources to learn about mobile development. Many students over time
have asked MDG to start a lecture series on Android development. Due
to constraints of resources we cannot neither invite everyone to
internal lectures nor can we conduct open lectures and exepct everyone
to grasp everythin; but internet is open for everyone. This is the
reason we are starting an online series on Android development and
other concepts so that everyone can learn alongside the core members
of the group.

What will this blog series cover?
----
The blog series would be primarily concerned about Android development
and related concepts, with a few blogs on upcoming technologies like
Blockchain, DeepLearning etc. We would be posting several blogs
spanning several weeks which would start with basics of Android and
then would deal with more advanced concepts of Android. This blogs
will be beginner friendly so that anyone with knowledge of basic Java
would be able to gain considerable amount of knowledge. A new blog
will be added after every new internal lecture and will contain the
same resources as given to the core members. All the resources will
also be added to our github repo and students can raise issues and
contribute.

What will be the frequency of new blogs ?
----
Since we have already conducted 3-4 internal lectures, so the blog
containing the resources related to those lectures will be uploaded
first. So expect a new blog in intervals of 2-3 days. After we get
over with these blogs, new blogs will be released in sync with
internal lectures and thus the frequency of new blogs will reduce to
once a week, to give students enough time to grasp the concepts and
experiment on their own.

How can I participate?
----
Each blog post would be added to our website's blog and to our
lecture's GitHub repo, at the end of each blog we'll add few problems
which will be related to the lecture. To submit solution, fork the
repo and create a pull request with your solution in a new directory.

You can find the first blog on Git and Linux [here](103.37.200.126/wail).

If you have any questions regarding the series or the any of the
blogs, please ask us in the comments section below or at
our [chat portal](http://mdg.iitr.ac.in/chat).
